Hopefully this section has provided you with some of the Spring Boot basics, and got you on your way to writing your own applications. If you¡¯re a task-oriented type of developer you might want to jump over to spring.io and check out some of the getting started guides that solve specific ¡°How do I do that with Spring¡± problems; we also have Spring Boot-specific How-to reference documentation.

The Spring Boot repository has also a bunch of samples you can run. The samples are independent of the rest of the code (that is you don¡¯t need to build the rest to run or use the samples).

Otherwise, the next logical step is to read Part III, wangping ¡°Using Spring Boot¡±. If you¡¯re really impatient, you could also jump ahead and read about Spring Boot features.
